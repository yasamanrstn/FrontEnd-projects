            this chapter is about saving yourself when no one else
            will. they can’t hear the demons taunting you in your
            head and they can’t feel your heart weeping through
            the silence. sometimes the princess in the tower doesn’t
            need a prince, sometimes the evil queen doesn’t trap
            her up there. sometimes she traps herself in the small,
            tall tower overlooking the gray skies. and sometimes
            they won’t hear her cry for help. this is the time where
            the little princess decides to save herself. sometimes
            she isn’t even a princess, she’s just a girl with a
            wandering mind. she can fight the demons herself and
            she can climb down herself. it takes time. but she can
            do it. this chapter is about saving yourself so no one
            else has to.<br>
            he tried to fight for you<br>
            but he didn’t fight hard<br>
            enough<br>
            he didn’t seem to sharpen<br>
            his sword, instead<br>
            he lost the<br>
            battle<br>
            and you were left in the<br>
            castle<br>
            you don’t need<br>
            someone to save<br>
            you from the tower<br>
            just save yourself.<br>
        </p>

        <p style="color: #33305f;font-size: 30px;">
            this chapter is the one that is the most painful to
            organize. this chapter is for the love poems. the ones
            you wish you could erase, but they were true. and they
            were written on these sad pages. sometimes you wish
            you could erase their face from your memories,
            because sometimes you think you’d be better off
            without their face replaying in your thoughts at night.
            but you don’t regret them, because when you look back
            on the memories you’re reminded that there’s someone
            that amazing out there. and maybe this time it didn’t
            work, but maybe one day you’ll find someone better
            for you. this is the chapter for the love poems you
            dread to look back on and refresh yourself on how
            much you miss them. and yes. you do miss them. and
            you’re allowed to say that, even if they don’t miss you.<br>
            you<br>
            had a house<br>
            built out of bricks<br>
            and cement that only<br>
            ended up being abandoned<br>
            he<br>
            built me a house<br>
            with his own hands<br>
            out of sticks and mud<br>
            that is full of more<br>
            life<br>
            than any other<br>
            house on the road.<br>
            - money isn’t everything.<br>
            i fell in<br>
            love with your<br>
            mind and<br>
            soul before<br>
            i fell in<br>
            love with<br>
            what’s<br>
            in your<br>
            wallet<br>
            and your<br>
            pants.<br>
            true.<br>
            your heart is<br>
            almost<br>
            as empty<br>
            as your<br>
            promises.<br>

            to the thought of me. sometimes i hope you see a clear blue sky and you
            remember my eyes lighting up for such a nice day. sometimes i wonder if you
            still remember my face in all the memories we had. sometimes i wish you
            were still here, but if you wanted to be then you would be. you chose to leave,
            oh well.<br>
            not talking to me<br>
            leads you<br>
            nowhere<br>
            sometimes i hope you put mayonnaise on your fries and your mind wanders<br>
            you always ask me<br>
            what does the “look” mean?<br>
            “the look” means<br>
            i can’t believe someone<br>
            as amazing as you<br>
            is spending their time with<br>
            someone like me<br>
            “the look” means<br>
            i look at you and can see you<br>
            as the only person in the world<br>
            so many constant thoughts<br>
            in my mind<br>
            constantly hurting me<br>
            repeating the words you told it<br>
            we’re sitting<br>
            in a field<br>
            of dandelions<br>
            and grass<br>
            just watching<br>
            the time<br>
            tick away and<br>
            pass<br>
        </p>

        <p style="color: #33305f;font-size: 30px;">
            i keep on having this recurring dream, that i see you in the distance and
            naturally i start walking to you. and as i get closer and closer i make eye
            contact with you and i fall down, this deep hole… then i wake up. the last
            image in my head in the morning is you watching me fall so helplessly down
            this hole, screaming and shouting. and you watch my with no expression, and
            no sense to help me.<br>
            - maybe it foreshadowed something?<br>
            if it was<br>
            easy to<br>
            move on<br>
            then it<br>
            wouldn’t<br>
            be love<br>
            would it?<br>
            i wrote you two love poems yesterday<br>
            i wrapped them together,<br>
            put a bow around them and i was going to hide them somewhere you’d
            find.
            the hope from yesterday made me so inspired, i thought i’d do something for
            you
            this morning was my first heartbreak you’ve given me,
            i say first because even in the slight chance you come back, i know i won’t
            refuse.<br>
            i need you<br>
            even as a friend<br>
            i don’t need time to myself<br>
            please see that<br>
            you can come back and hurt me all you want<br>
            and what i know is<br>
            i’ll never stop loving you<br>
            - a tragedy<br>
            this heartbreak is<br>
            nothing like the others<br>
            because this heartbreak<br>
            is something that<br>
            i know you<br>
            wouldn’t have<br>
            chosen<br>
            i just wanted to let you know,<br>
            i’m always here for you,<br>
            whenever you need me<br>
            please just dm me, and<br>
            i’ll answer,<br>
            even if you just want to talk about your day or something silly<br>
            i’m here for you<br>
            and<br>
            i’m not leaving anytime soon<br>
            (unless you want me to)<br>
