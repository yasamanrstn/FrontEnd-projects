            Death-Cast is calling with the warning of a lifetime—I’m going to die today.
            Forget that, “warning” is too strong a word since warnings suggest something
            can be avoided, like a car honking at someone who’s crossing the street when
            it isn’t their light, giving them the chance to step back; this is more of a
            heads-up. The alert, a distinctive and endless gong, like a church bell one
            block away, is blasting from my phone on the other side of the room. I’m
            freaking out already, a hundred thoughts immediately drowning out
            everything around me. I bet this chaos is what a first-time skydiver feels as
            she’s plummeting out of a plane, or a pianist playing his first concert. Not
            that I will ever know for sure.  I’ve always been afraid of dying. I don’t know why I thought this would
            jinx it from actually happening. Not forever, obviously, but long enough so I
            could grow up. Dad has even been drilling it into my head that I should
            pretend I’m the main character of a story that nothing bad ever happens to,
            most especially death, because the hero has to be around to save the day. But
            the noise in my head is quieting down and there’s a Death-Cast herald on the
            other end of the phone waiting to tell me I’m going to die today at eighteen
            years old.
            about how life isn’t always fair, then lists some events I could participate in
            today. I shouldn’t be mad at her, but it’s obvious she’s bored reciting these
            lines that have been burned into memory from telling hundreds, maybe
            thousands, about how they’ll soon be dead. She has no sympathy to offer me.
            She’s probably filing her nails or playing tic-tac-toe against herself as she
            talks to me.
            On CountDowners, Deckers post entries about everything from their
            phone call to how they’re spending their End Day. It’s basically Twitter for
            Deckers. I’ve read tons of feeds where Deckers admitted to asking their
            heralds how they would die, but it’s basic knowledge that those specifics
            aren’t available to anyone, not even former President Reynolds, who tried to
            hide from Death in an underground bunker four years ago and was
            assassinated by one of his own secret service agents. Death-Cast can only
            provide a date for when someone is going to die, but not the exact minute or
            how it’ll happen.

            But I will never grow up to be Future Mateo. No one will ever get high
            with me, no one will be my audience as I play piano, and no one will sit
            shotgun in my dad’s car after I get my license. I’ll never fight with friends
            over who gets the better bowling shoes or who gets to be Wolverine when we
            play video games.
            I collapse back onto the floor, thinking about how it’s do or die now. Not
            even that.
            Do, and then die.
            12:42 a.m.
            Dad takes hot showers to cool down whenever he’s upset or disappointed in
            himself. I copied him around the time I turned thirteen because confusing
            Mateo Thoughts surfaced and I needed tons of Mateo Time to sort through
            them. I’m showering now because I feel guilty for hoping the world, or some
            part of it beyond Lidia and my dad, will be sad to see me go. Because I
            refused to live invincibly on all the days I didn’t get an alert, I wasted all
            those yesterdays and am completely out of tomorrows.
            I’m not going to tell anyone. Except Dad, but he’s not even awake so it
            doesn’t really count. I don’t want to spend my last day wondering if people
            are being genuine when they throw sad words at me. No one should spend
            their last hours second-guessing people.
            I’ve got to get out into the world, though, trick myself into thinking it is
            any other day. I’ve got to see Dad at the hospital and hold his hand for the
            first time since I was a kid and for what will be the last . . . wow, the last time
            ever.
            I’ll be gone before I can adjust to my mortality.
            I also have to see Lidia and her one-year-old, Penny. Lidia named me
            Penny’s godfather when the baby was born, and it sucks how I’m the person
            expected to take care of her in case Lidia passes away since Lidia’s
            boyfriend, Christian, died a little over a year ago. 
        </p>

        <p  style="color: #33305f;font-size: 30px;">
            who Lidia may tell stories about, during which Penny will nod her head,
            maybe make fun of my glasses, and then flip the page to family she actually
            knows and cares about. I won’t even be a ghost to her. But that’s no reason to
            not go tickle her one more time or wipe squash and green peas off her face, or
            give Lidia a little break so she can focus on studying for her GED or brush
            her teeth or comb her hair or take a nap.
            After that, I will somehow pull myself away from my best friend and her
            daughter, and I will have to go and live.
            I turn off the faucet and the water stops raining down on me; today isn’t
            the day for an hour shower. I grab my glasses off the sink and put them on. I
            step out of the tub, slipping on a puddle of water, and while falling backward
            I’m expecting to see if that theory of your life flashing before your eyes
            carries any truth to it when I grab hold of the towel rack and catch myself. I
            breathe in and out, in and out, because dying this way would just be an
            extremely unfortunate way to go; someone would add me to the “Shower
            KO” feed on the DumbDeaths blog, a high-traffic site that grosses me out on
            so many levels.
            I need to get out of here and live—but first I have to make it out of this
            apartment alive.
            12:56 a.m.
            I write thank-you notes for my neighbors in 4F and 4A, telling them it’s my
            End Day. With Dad in the hospital, Elliot in 4F has been checking in on me,
            bringing me dinner, especially since our stove has been busted for the past
            week after I tried making Dad’s empanadas. Sean in 4A was planning on
            stopping by on Saturday to fix the stove’s burner, but it’s not necessary
            anymore. Dad will know how to fix it and might need a distraction when I’m
            gone.
            I go into my closet and pull out the blue-and-gray flannel shirt Lidia got
            me for my eighteenth birthday, then put it on over my white T-shirt. I haven’t
            worn it outside yet. The shirt is how I get to keep Lidia close today.
            I check my watch—an old one of Dad’s he gave me after buying a digital
            one that could glow, for his bad eyes—and it’s close to 1:00 a.m. On a
            regular day, I would be playing video games until late at night, even if it
            meant going to school exhausted. At least I could fall asleep during my free
            periods. I shouldn’t have taken those frees for granted. I should’ve taken up
            another class, like art, even though I can’t draw to save my life. (Or do
            anything to save my life, obviously, and I want to say that’s neither here nor
            there, but it pretty much is everything, isn’t it?) Maybe I should’ve joined
            band and played piano, gotten some recognition before working my way up
            to singing in the chorus, then maybe a duet with someone cool, and then
            maybe braving a solo. Heck, even theater could’ve been fun if I’d gotten to
            play a role that forced me to break out. But no, I elected for another free
            period where I could shut down and nap.

        <p  style="color: #33305f;font-size: 30px;">
            It’s 1:00 a.m.
            I can’t believe I’m never returning to my bedroom.
            I unlock the front door, turn the knob, and pull the door open.
            I shake my head and slam the door shut.
            I’m not walking out into a world that will kill me before my time.
